#Neural Networks and Loan Decisions
* "How Neural Networks can Help Loan officers make better informed decisions" http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.9.3652&rep=rep1&type=pdf

* I'm not sure a neural network is the answer to this. Loan approvals are a highly biased process and is based on factors that can be "passed down." I feel that based on your training data, your model will be skewed--a con for neural networks. However, I'm not sure humans are less error prone. Perhaps the goal is to have a neural network constantly monitored by a diverse party to help the approval be "just"--at least as much as possible.

* Respond to posts from at least 3 of our classmates.
