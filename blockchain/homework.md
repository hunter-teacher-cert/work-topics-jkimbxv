###Block Chain HW Mild

1. Find an article about blockchain application

2. Why do you like it? Potential benefits?
I personally think the way we prove identity is archaic. We have to save a piece of paper that can be easily be digested by a poorly placed moth. Birth certificate, SSN card, etc. I think the benefit is to have a more robust, fault tolerant way to prove yourself. You could also extend things like to prove vaccination status (pre covid! Getting my vaccination record for this online program was quite the journey)

3. Potential problems?
It requires seamless communication between all systems and devices. This may also not work in resource poor areas where internet connections are not stable.
