#you will need to complete the jalapeno assignment before completing the habanero assignment.

#copy and paste your working jalapeno code here:


def enigmaMachine(secret,key):
    #utilising the decrypt functino from jalapeno
    #find a way to stack 6 vigenere ciphers on top of each other
    #enigma machine is a rotor based encryption enigmaMachine
    #simulates 6 vigenre ciphers
    #use the flow chart from slide 26
    #returns an encrypted string

message1 = "Hey this is a secret"
key1 = "apcsp"
encrypted1 = enigmaMachine(message1,key);
