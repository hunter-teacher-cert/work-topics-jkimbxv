#Networks
Long ago, computers were not connected but now they are connected to some sort of terminal

1. Physical layer: computers are connected via electric wires
2. Data Link Layer: protocols
* mac address: unique to every network card
* what happens if there's a duplicate signal on the network?
3. Network Layer
* Class A (111. xxx.xxx.xxx), more ip addresses possible
* Class B (111.222.xxx.xxx), less ip addresses
* Class C
